A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation.

#### How DC motors work?

All electric motors develop torque by alternating the polarity of rotating magnets attached to the rotor and stationary magnets on the surrounding stator. At least one of these set of magnets is an electromagnet, made from a coil of wire around an iron core.

In a DC motor, DC running through the wire winding creates the magnetic field. Each time the armature rotates by 180°, the position of the north and south poles are reversed. If the magnetic field of the poles remained the same, the rotor would not turn. To create torque in one direction in a DC motor, the direction of the electric current must be reversed with every 180° turn of the armature.

In a traditional brushed motor, this would be done by a commutator, but in a brushless DC motor, an electronic sensor instead detects the angle of the rotor, with controlled semiconductor switches either reversing the direction of the current or turning it off at the correct time in the rotation to create torque in one direction.


#### Type of DC motor
This section of the guide will look at the four main types of DC motor - brushless, brushed, shunt, and series.
